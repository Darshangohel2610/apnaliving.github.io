Here's a prompt summary that covers our work so far, the technologies and frameworks used, and the current state of the project:

You are working on a website project called "Apna Living," which is a professional PG (Paying Guest) accommodation listing platform similar to 99acres and MagicBricks. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend.

So far, you have completed the following tasks:

1. **Navbar**: Created a responsive navbar with the website logo, navigation links ("Home," "PG Listing," "About Us" with a dropdown menu for "Contact Us" and "FAQs"), and a "Log in" button.

2. **Hero Section**: Implemented a hero section with a background image, a search bar, and a welcome message.

3. **Top Cities Section**: Developed a section to showcase the top cities for PG listings. Each city is displayed in a card format, and within each city card, there are individual PG listings showcased horizontally on smaller screens and in a grid layout on larger screens.

The technologies and frameworks used in this project are:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the website content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout purposes.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework used for creating responsive and mobile-first website designs.
- **JavaScript** (optional): While not implemented yet, you may need to use JavaScript for adding interactivity, form validations, and other dynamic functionalities.

The current state of the project includes:

- A responsive navbar with navigation links and a dropdown menu.
- A hero section with a search bar and a welcome message.
- A "Top Cities" section featuring a city card with individual PG listings displayed horizontally on smaller screens and in a grid layout on larger screens.

The next steps could involve:

- Adding more sections or components, such as featured PG listings, testimonials, amenities, and a footer.
- Implementing modals, lightboxes, or accordions to display detailed information about each PG listing.
- Integrating JavaScript for interactivity, form validations, and dynamic content updates.
- Connecting the frontend to a backend server or API for fetching and displaying real PG data.
- Enhancing the overall design, accessibility, and performance of the website.

With this summary, you can pick up from where we left off and continue working on the "Apna Living" website project, leveraging the existing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap codebase while incorporating additional features and functionalities as needed.
